## Final Project Code and Data

* Due Tuesday 2016/5/24 (last day of exam period) at 9am.
* You must fork this repository as described in the [HW Submission 
Exercise](https://github.com/Middlebury-Data-Science/HW-0#hw-submission-exercise).
* Ensure all data files and CSV files are in the folder `data`. So for example, 
say you want to load the the file `example.csv` in the `data` folder.  You need 
to run `read.csv("data/example.csv", header=TRUE)` and not 
`read.csv("example.csv", header=TRUE)`.
* Fill in the project details below.
* Delete everything in this file before the section "Project Details".
* Push/commit **all files** necessary for me to reproduce your final report.


#### Repository README Cover Page

Any good repository on GitHub will have an informative cover page. It is an
advertisement of your work and should give basic instructions on how to use
it/replicate your work. The contents of the file `README.md` end up being what's
on the repository cover page. For example:

* The [repo page for `dplyr`](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr).
* The contents of its [`README.md` file](https://github.com/hadley/dplyr/blob/master/README.md) (click on RAW).

The way you will create your `README.md` is via `README.Rmd`:

* **DO NOT EDIT** `README.md`
* Rather, edit `README.Rmd` and then Knit it. An updated `README.md` file will
be outputted.
* When you push/commit `README.md`, it will show up as your repo's cover page.
